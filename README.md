# How to use
It doesn't really work right now by itself, and no, index.js is NOT a bookmarklet. It is a NodeJS app for the backend of this program. Once the full frontend and backend are done, I will repkace this message with a link to the frontend repo.

# Contributing

Please don't ask for write access to this repo, instead, fork the repo, make the changes and send a pull request. This will make it much easier to integrate contributions.
